# Encrypted File Transfer System using TCP Sockets

This project simulates a secure communication system designed for battlefield environments. It facilitates the transmission of structured target data from a client to a server using TCP socket programming in Python.

Target details such as unit name, type, speed, and reporting time are extracted from an Excel file, converted into a well-formed XML document, and securely transferred over a TCP connection. This system ensures data integrity and simulates secure military command and control scenarios.

## Features

- Extracts structured target data from Excel spreadsheets
- Converts Excel data into well-structured XML format using Python and Pandas
- Sends XML file over a secure TCP client-server connection
- Listens, receives, and stores the incoming XML file on the server side
- Verifies file receipt and integrity on the destination
- Simulates real-world defense and control communication scenarios

## Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `XML_generator.py` | Reads Excel file and generates an XML file |
| `client.py` | Sends the generated XML file to the server |
| `server.py` | Receives XML files via TCP and stores them |
| `demo_database.xlsx` | Sample Excel data containing target details |
| `output.xml` | XML file generated by the client |
| `received_file.xml` | XML file saved by the server after receiving |
| `README.md` | Documentation for the project |

## How to Run

> Ensure Python is installed and both client and server are on the same network (or localhost for testing).

```bash
# Step 1: Generate XML from Excel
python XML_generator.py

# Step 2: Start the server (receiver)
python server.py

# Step 3: Send XML file from the client
python client.py
```

## Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Pandas (Excel data processing)  
- TCP Socket Programming  
- XML Processing  
- Excel (.xlsx)  
- Linux/Windows CLI (tested on both)

## Internship Context

This project was developed as part of an internship at **Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL)**, under the **D&Eâ€“DCCS** division.  
It was intended to simulate secure file transmission protocols and battlefield communication systems in defense-grade environments.
