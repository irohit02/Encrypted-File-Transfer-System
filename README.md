# Encrypted File Transfer System using TCP Sockets

This project simulates a secure battlefield communication system by transmitting structured data from a client to a server using TCP sockets. Target details such as unit name, type, speed, and reporting time are extracted from an Excel file, converted into XML using Python and Pandas, and securely transferred between systems.

## 🛠️ Features
- Extracts and processes real-world target data
- Converts Excel data to well-structured XML
- Sends XML file over a secure TCP client-server system
- Saves and verifies received files
- Mimics defence command & control scenarios

## 📂 Project Structure

- `XML_generator.py` – Converts Excel data to XML  
- `client.py` – Sends XML file over TCP to server  
- `server.py` – Listens for incoming XML and saves it  
- `demo_database.xlsx` – Sample data with target information  
- `output.xml` – XML file generated by the client  
- `received_file.xml` – XML file received by the server  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Generate XML**  
   `python XML_generator.py`

2. **Start Server (Receiver)**  
   `python server.py`

3. **Send from Client**  
   `python client.py`

## 🧰 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, TCP Socket Programming, XML, Excel, Linux

## 📄 Internship Context
Built during my internship at **Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL)** under the **D&E–DCCS** division to simulate secure file transmission for battlefield communication.
